# Event-Announcement-System


![te](https://github.com/YomiDavies/Event-Announcement-System/blob/main/Event_Notification_website.png)

I built a notification platform that enables users to create events and receive real-time updates via email. Itâ€™s a lightweight yet scalable system using AWSâ€™s core offerings:

âœ… Amazon S3 â€“ Hosted the static website and stored event data in a JSON format.

âœ… AWS SNS (Simple Notification Service) â€“ Handled email subscriptions and notifications for new events.

âœ… AWS Lambda â€“ Powered the backend logic, including creating events and managing subscriber data.

âœ… Amazon API Gateway â€“ Provided RESTful endpoints to facilitate communication between the frontend and backend.

âœ… IAM Roles & Policies â€“ Implemented to enforce secure access control between AWS services.

ðŸ’¡ Key Skills Demonstrated:

Building serverless applications with AWS

API design and integration

Event-driven architecture

Secure resource management using IAM

End-to-end project deployment using only AWS services

ðŸ“Œ Takeaway:
This project gave me practical experience with deploying real-world cloud solutions. I learned how to connect multiple AWS services effectively while maintaining security and scalabilityâ€”skills Iâ€™m eager to bring into a professional role.
